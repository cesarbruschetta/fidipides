# Contributing to Fidípides

The Fidípides project welcomes contributions from all developers. The high level
process for development matches many other open source projects. See below for
an outline:

* Fork this repository.
* Make your changes. Format your code with `gofmt` or `goimports` and try to
  follow the style of the surrounding code.
* Add an entry to the CHANGELOG.
* [Submit a pull request][prs] (PR) to this repository with your changes, and
  unit tests whenever possible.
* If your PR fixes any [issues][issues], make sure you write Fixes #1234 in
  your PR description (where #1234 is the number of the issue you're closing).
* The Fidípides core contributors will review your code. After each of them sign
  off on your code, they'll comment your PR with `LGTM`. Once that happens, the
  contributors will merge it.
